<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, My name is Lucas and I am an enthusiatic web developer</p>

<p>I come from a family of teachers and during lockdown I decided to get myself into geek like activities,
  such as board games and 3D printing. I am self taught 3D designer (also managed to design and 3D print
  a fully working bagpipe, very cool isn't it?). And that moment was the gateway to also get into web development
  and find out that I love doing it (jusyt like any other nedr like activity).
  Now, that I have completed my course, I want to help people to build great websites, ti show the world who they are and what they do
</p>
